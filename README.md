# Function and Error

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates basic error handling mechanisms using 'require', 'assert', and 'revert' statements. The contract allows an owner to set a number and provides functions to validate and demonstrate the correct handling of errors.

## Description

The 'ErrorHandling' contract allows an owner to set a 'number' and provides several functions to interact with and validate the value of this 'number'. The contract includes mechanisms for error handling to ensure only the owner can modify the 'number' and that certain conditions are met when using the contract's functions.
